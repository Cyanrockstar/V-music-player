How to download the project : 
To download a GitHub repository, navigate to the repository page, click the "Code" button, and then choose to either "Download ZIP" for a single archive or "Clone with HTTPS" to clone the repository using a command-line tool like Git. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Access the Repository:
Go to the GitHub website and find the repository you want to download.
If it's a public repository, you can visit the page without logging in. If it's a private repository, you'll need to log in and have the proper permissions. 
2. Download as a ZIP Archive:
On the repository page, click the green "Code" button.
In the dropdown menu, click "Download ZIP".
The entire repository will be downloaded to your device as a zipped file. 
3. Clone with Git (Recommended for Developers):
On the repository page, click the green "Code" button. 
Under "HTTPS", copy the URL for the repository. 
Open your terminal or command prompt. 
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. 
Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL (e.g., git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git). 
This will create a local copy of the repository in the directory you specified. 
4. Using GitHub Desktop:
If you prefer a GUI, you can use GitHub Desktop.
In the File menu, click Clone Repository.
Choose the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone or manually enter the repository location.
